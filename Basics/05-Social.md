## Intro

### What

Marketing on social networks is a strategy that consists in making social media platforms the privileged point of contact between your brand and its customers (current or future).

The objectives are diversified, increase its notoriety, federate a community, generate traffic to its website. In the end, increase its prospects and conversion rates.

The advantages are also numerous, it is an accessible strategy and quite simple to implement, less expensive than paid advertising (just your time to create content) and less time-consuming than SEO (long-term strategy).

### Choose the right

Each social media has its own audience and its own codes. The content shared on Instagram and TikTok is not the same, and your followers on these two apps will be significantly different.

To make this choice, you need to:

- **Identify your audience**: Who is your audience, their age, their income, their interests
- **Define your objectives**: Gain notoriety, create a community by building customer loyalty or reach a new audience.

Depending on your answers, the choice will be different, without going into details each network has its own targets, a different approach and its advantages.
Facebook targets a more adult clientele and will mainly focus on loyalty, Twitter will be very useful to make your brand known, Pinterest for visual content, Linkedin for B2B, Instagram to target a very large audience, TikTok to target young people of course and finally Youtube for video content but in a broader spectrum, it is a real search engine that must be dealt with.

# Basics

## Context

This part deals with the main concepts of marketing as well as its main components.
Of course, we will focus on Google and its tools in this part, not only because it still occupies a majority place on the market but because it also provides a good support for training, whether it is marketing, SEO, analysis tools, campaign and all that in the same sphere.

NB: Once you have the first basics, you can also take a look in the lab !

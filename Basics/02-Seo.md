## Intro

When we talk about referencing, we can differentiate 2 types, the natural (SEO) and the paid (SEA). We will talk about paid search engine optimization later, but on this path, we will focus on natural search engine optimization, how it works, the criteria to respect, the mechanisms, the points of attention, the tools and the way to set them up.

What is SEO ?
Let's start with its definition, Search Engine Optimization

This term refers to all the techniques implemented to improve the position of a website on the results pages of search engines (SERP). Also called natural referencing or organic referencing.The objective of SEO is to improve the visibility of websites on search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing, ...).

As the saying goes, the second page of Google is the best place to hide, it's a joke but it's also a fact, most Internet users will not go to the second page and that's why SEO is a vital need for the proper functioning of any business.

## How it works ?

Obviously, given its place on the market, we will focus on Google, once again, it is a must and if we want a quality referencing, we will have to deal with it.

### Small review, how google refer our site ?

Some people will tell you that SEO is something difficult and that getting a good referencing is complicated. It's true, if you don't respect google's indexing criteria, otherwise it's quite simple, we could summarize it like this:

* Internet users search in Google by typing "keywords

* Google seeks to present the best result to these users by indexing pages and sorting the results

* Your site, via your content brings an answer to the request of these users through the indexing of Google

and that's all..., not so complicated...

### Let's detail the functioning of an indexing robot

To index your site, the search engine will navigate through your content by exploring the different pages with indexing robots in order to collect a maximum of data and establish a deep description of your site. This is what we call the "[crawling](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7646114?hl=en)", in order, the robot will analyze the HTML source code, explore the links, as soon as it arrives on a new page, it will repeat this process.

To facilitate the indexing, you will have to set up a "Robots.txt" file, identifying which pages and which links must be crawled in order to index them, thanks to the user-agent directive which will define the access rules

### Algorithm update ?

The Google algo is constantly evolving and we will base ourselves on the current standard, nevertheless, if you want some historical context, and if you want to keep up to date, you can find all the updates and future changes, directly on the [google blog](https://developers.google.com/search/blog)

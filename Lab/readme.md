## Context

As presented in the course readme, this module is a sandbox in which you will be able to put into practice some of the essential needs of today's marketing by broadening the spectrum of your skills in a fast and productive way.

As you will have understood, we will mainly talk about shortcuts, but also about the tools you need to know how to use and the different little tricks you need to know to save time or simply to manage a new component of your projects.

You will find an add-on part, with different components to discover, then the tools part, which gathers the list of free tools to use and finally the project part, which will propose you to put these elements or some of them at the service of a complete strategy and on the basis of your course on marketing in a more global way.

Go back to the base of your project and work on the elements that you can already adapt, modify, correct, add so that your strategy fits into the existing project.

**NB :** On your other projects, there is an additional capital step to optimize your strategy, we will not deal with it here, because the project is fictitious, for all the other projects that you could realize, this one is essential.

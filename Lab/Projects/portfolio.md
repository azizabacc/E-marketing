# Portfolio

* Type : Solo

Work on your image to develop your professional insertion, any good IT recruiter will prefer an online portfolio from a CV, and a personal project from an online portfolio. So it's a great way for potential employers to "know" you and see what you like doing, the things that keep you working late at night and on week-ends. In a word: your motivation.

## What

This challenge is a red thread project, but also a sandbox, a project in which you will be able to put forward all the skills you have developed during your career but also by working on your image, just imagine that here the product is you and the target is a potential employer.

Take stock of the different steps to respect in order to create this one, the needs, the target, the content, the projects to put forward, the networks where you could broadcast, the way to do it, everything that could help you to put forward your skills and bring you more visibility.

## How

Nothing too complicated, simplicity is always what works best, especially since here we're going to work on the envelope, not what's in it, of course you'll need to show projects related to the positions you're aiming for, but think about what's going to contain all of this, it saves you from just sending your github profile and it allows you to easily feed visibility to your projects.

### Must have

* Identity: Name, logo, graphic charter, images

* Structure: The components and the different sections of your page (home, projects, about, contact...)

* Ux : Always think about who is going to visit your page, before anything else, before optimizing the SEO, before the deep understanding of the google algo, always think about the user experience.

* SEO minimum survival: The vital minimum for a project launch (domain)

* Content : Projects to show and highlight by bridging the repository and related resources.

* Network : Links to networks, with an activity (linkedin, medium, ...)

### Nice to have

* Projects : Always more projects, what will make the difference, get projects from your training, refine the details, work the envelope and hop, integrate it to your portfolio.

* Blog : Feed a blog with articles relating your different experiences, on the networks, on your page or on both at the same time.

* Visibility: Work on your visibility by trying new strategies, exploiting new components, broadcasting on other networks, creating affiliations with your articles or projects, anything that could help optimize your visibility.

* Feed-back : Ask the people around you, make a small micro survey to know the opinions of everyone or the coach, he is there to tell you what are the elements to improve, the components that you could add, the projects that you could show, do not hesitate to ask for a feedback.

### Inspirations ?

Need a little inspiration? Don't worry, I invite you to have a look on this kind of website to see what are the main trends of today and use some elements with **consistency**.

Be careful though, **some portfolios have required months of work, some belong to graphic designers and the artistic aspect is sometimes pushed to the extremes, this is not the objective here, remember, simplicity and speed of production will always be the key words, just be inspired by the structure, the elements easily integrated and achievable, ...**

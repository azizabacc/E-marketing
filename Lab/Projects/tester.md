The goal of this challenge is just to be able to test, a component, a tool, a new resource and to put it in the form of a project in order to add it to your toolbox and to your experience, the topics can vary widely, whatever you want, it's up to you to define, the goal, the skills and the component you want to test.

To help you, I have a template structure to better focus your learning and define the criteria of it:

## Name : TBD...

* Type : TBD...(solo, group...)
* Duration : TBD...(estimating time to complete)

**Skills** : 

- TBD...(the skills worked on)

**Goals** : 

- TBD...("the purpose of the project")

**Must-have** :

- TBD ...(the criteria that absolutely must be validated)

**Nice to have** :

- TBD ...(little extras or improvements)

And that's it, this tester will allow you to practice your skills and create an additional learning sample, without forgetting that this one can bring you an additional element for your list of projects and thus work on your visibility and your motivation, so repeat a max of samples of your choice !

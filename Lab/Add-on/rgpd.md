## Intro

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union-wide regulation on how businesses and other organizations should deal with personal data. It has important implications for any organization that offers its services to EU citizens.

## Guide and cheatSheet

First of all this [link](https://gdpr.eu/), which includes all the legal texts, as well as a checklist point by point.

- [GDPR EU](https://gdpr.eu/)

From a more technical point of view, to be up to date with the GDPR, the CNIl provides a complete checklist with all the important points

- [GDPR developer guide](https://lincnil.github.io/GDPR-Developer-Guide/)

For the rest, if you want to work these points in depth, I add 2 rooms below to dive into this topic and get a small free certification at the same time

## Room

This room takes place on "L'atelier rgpd", it is a French training elaborated on the basis of the recommendations of the CNIL, so the topics covered are broader than what you will deal with on other platforms, nevertheless it is also very complete.

This room takes place on HubSpot (once again) and goes over the different important notions and gives you some concrete cases.

## What is a growth hacker :

### A little background

It's a term that you'll see often, that seems to be fashionable and yet is already starting to date ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking)), whether it's in the resources you'll consult, in the articles you'll read, in the videos, in the blogs, it's everywhere.
Let's have a look at it to know what it is

### A hacker, really ?

- No and again no, even if we can identify some correlations, it is not a hacker, the only similarities are the fact that we find the best resources on wacky and indigestible forums, that there is a terminology vaguely inspired by hacking and that sometimes we are going to divert the functioning of a tool/system from its primary use, but we stop there with the comparisons

### So, what is it?

NB: *If I had to invent a term, I would say "Ubiquitous marketer" but I'm getting into a counter debate and I'm going to sink into the mass of bullshiter pro...Innovation Alchemist, Chief Happiness Officer, Retail Jedi, Ninja Developper, ...", you see where I'm going with this, maketing is no exception to the rule (maybe the precursor) but you'll find other terms extravagant some will say, wacky and stupid others will say, "Marketing Rockstar, New Media Guru, Brand Evangelist ...", you also have a choice.*

- A Growth Hacker is simply a marketer who will focus on growth opportunities and not on brand positioning, the objective is to quickly prototype several strategies/tactics in order to filter samples and quickly test their growth rates and thus ensure a higher R.O.I by spending time on the most effective channels.

### Concretely

- In concrete terms, the spectrum and scope of the function will not be limited to classic marketing tactics such as SEO, PPC, SEM ... they will also spill over into the field of product, sales, support through gamification and do a little bit of everything at the same time, in short, everything that can induce a growth factor, as you can see on the image below.

## What to remember

### Skills

- They are numerous, as I said the spectrum is quite wide, notions in design, programming, writing, seo, sem, analysis and all other aspects that could bring more value to your strategy.

### Strat

There are also a few points that any marketing expert today should remember :

- **Sampling:** By trying a channel or tactic in a small experiment, you can avoid wasting a lot of time or money. If, during the course of an experiment, it appears that it is not working, you do not have to invest in it. If it does, you can keep exploring. In this way, a growth hacker ensures a higher ROI ("Return on Investment") by spending time on the most effective channels, PIE prioritization factors: Potential of success, Impact if successful & Ease/cost

- **Optimize your production and learning time:** You need to have about 20% of all the knowledge needed to do 80% of the work, you need to think in a hierarchy of needs to define your short, medium, long term learning ranges. Taking full control of a particular tool may not be useful for your short term needs but can save you a lot of time in the long term, automation is a perfect example.

- **Trying tactics:** The best growth factor is the one that doesn't exist yet, there are many interesting examples and case studies to exploit in the examples often mentioned, of course, these must be adapted to the needs of your project but can sometimes give you some inspiration, AirBnb, Ahref, Dollar Shave, or even BeCode, we will come back to the examples later.

In a general way, we could describe the growth hacking strategy as follows: 

1. Define achievable goals
1. Implement analytics to track your goals
1. Leverage your existing strengths
1. Execute the experiment
1. Optimize the experience
1. Repeat

### Case studies

- **AirBnb :** We could talk about the famous story of Kellogs boxes or craiglist, AirBnb is a master in marketing strategies and growth hacking.

- **Ahref :** With a cup of coffee at the biggest SEO conference, they managed to make their mark with a cup of coffee.

- **Dollar Shave :** And his memorable video, a pure example of leveraging growth using a completely unpacked video strategy.
Think of a problem in your industry and, using content marketing, show how your product could solve that problem. Video marketing, in particular, is an effective way to show your brand personality and get your message across.

- **BeCode :** On a smaller scale of course, because here the vision is to be able to do this at a lower cost, but gaming tournaments, code initiations for the general public, campaigns on naughty websites, distribution of condoms at festivals...

And many others, the list is long, you can find more examples and case studies in the [Tools](../Tools/)

All these examples go far beyond the scope of your functions but that is also the principle of growth hacking, do not hesitate to look at opportunities rather than doing what we know how to do, with the spectrum of your skills, try to make links with the various factors of growth and try to see where you can act.

## Resources and practice ?

Growth hacking is the perfect example of the role you could play in your company, someone who can intervene at several levels in the chain.

To go further, if I have to recommend a resource, it is this one: [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/growth-hacking-websites).

I warn you already, the best resources are on old rotten forums, nevertheless, now that you have the context, take a step back on the information.

# Add-on

**Disclaimer :** This part will change regularly, with additions, whether it is new certifications, new trainings on specific topics, relevant topics to address or simply resources to share.
Not all topics are mandatory and not all of them will be useful, at least, maybe not right away, the goal is to offer you a toolbox/ideas that could be useful in one of your projects and/or in your learning, keeping in mind the link between creation (your skills) and conversion (the marketing context). The advantage is that you will not lose access to this repo so these resources will always be available to you, no matter when.

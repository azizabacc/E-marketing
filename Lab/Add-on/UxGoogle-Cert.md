## Context

Google/Coursera offers us some online learning slots to obtain this certificate.

* Added value :
    - Free access until December 2023 (after this date your access will be withdrawn, no payment will be requested) 

    - You can follow the program at your own pace and according to your schedule (but you must remain active, if more than 30 days of inactivity = remove from the program)

* Process :

    - Ask your e-marketing coach/coach/career coach to provide you with access and add you to our database.

NB : Just keep in mind that stocks are limited so don't sign up out of curiosity, you can find other interesting sources of information in this case, check the resources section ;) and I invite you to discuss it with the e-marketing referent of your campus or with your career coach to see if it's worth it.

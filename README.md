## What ?

2 phases, fast, because time is money and you'll see, after a journey through the basics, the best way to progress and learn will be to jump into your projects.
I know, your comfort zone, your need to understand the tools well before doing it, your doubts about your skills, forget all that if you want to take this course, otherwise it is not for you.

We will do the opposite, thanks to the skills you have developed during your course and as soon as you have the minimum of the e-marketing "first aid kit" (Basics), we will dive directly into the techniques that will allow you to be effective quickly and especially the way to approach a tool, an issue or a project.

The 2 parts can be done simultaneously, if you want to vary the pleasures and plan your days in a diversified way. Be careful though, I advise you to finish the digital garage part for those who are just starting out and for the lab part, keep in mind that you must always make the link with your strategy and the needs of your project, if you are missing some concepts, you will not be able to make the right shortcuts.

* [Basics](./Basics/0-Intro.md) (marketing, e-marketing, SEO, SEA, social media, google analytics, ...)
    - *This module aims to understand and apply the basics of digital marketing through the different themes that compose it, its implementation in the code, its management on social networks and on Youtube, the analysis for optimization and other important tools to have a complete view on its importance and its daily management.*

* [Lab](./Lab/) (project, tips, resources, tools)
    - *This module serves as a common thread to link both the basics of marketing, what you cover in the basics module and the training you have just completed for 5 months, how to link your skills as a developer with those of today's marketing. There will be practice with some projects, which are slightly outside the framework of classical marketing but which will allow you to approach the chain at several stages, from the product to the image, we will also discuss the optimization of classical strategies, the essential tools, some tips and possible shortcuts with your skills of course.*

Ready ? Ok, [let's go](./Basics/0-Intro.md) ;)
